**Rules of Hooks**

1. **Only call Hooks *inside of Component or Other Hook Functions***
    - React Hooks must not be called outside of React component functions or other Hook functions
2. **Only call Hooks *on the top level***
    - React Hooks must not be called in nested code statements (e.g., inside of if-statements)
